        <h4>Wishlist</h4>
        
        <p>
          Current Wishlist is as follows
        </p> 

        <ul>
          <li>A scrolling page with a fixed image background</li>
          <li>A floating navigation menu (that will scroll down when you scroll)</li>
          <li>Smooth page transitions (especially when going from one page to another)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>HTML, CSS and DOM analogy</h4>
        
        <p>
          The way I think of the describing HTML, CSS and DOM would be in terms of baking a cake.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>HTML (The Recipe):</b> A cake recipe tells you what ingredients you use, what order to mix it together, and how long it should be cooked for, etc. Similarly, HTML simply tells a web-browser what elements (ingredients) need to be used, in what order, etc.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>DOM (The Cake):</b> If two different people each bake a cake following the same recipe, there is no guarantee that those two cakes will be EXACTLY the same. This is because each person may use slightly different ingredients, or use them in slightly different proportions, etc. Essentially, each cake is that person's interpretation of the recipe. Similarly, the Document Object Model is how a specific web browser (the person) has interpreted that particular page of HTML, and converted it into a web page. The result is that not each web page may look exactly the same on each browser, as each browser (or person) has interpreted it slightly differently.
          

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>CSS (The Decorations):</b> Cakes that have the same recipe may be decorated differently, e.g. icing flavour and color, fruit, etc. Similarly, CSS can be thought of the decorations of a web page (e.g. how it's dressed and formatted). I suppose you could also include the shape of the cake tin, or how the cake is shaped once out of the tin as also being part of the decorating (and hence relate that to the structure/shape of our web-page). 
        </p>
        

        <h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
        
        <p>
          Boxifying design is simply a way to breakdown the structure of a web page. Since everything in a web page is essentially 'a box'. Boxifying a web page helps to visualise the different components that make up a web page, which helps to determine how exactly a web page has been set out. This is especially helpful when you need to turn a web page design into an actual page.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the box model?</h4>
        
        <p>
          The box model is a representation of how each visual element on a web page is represented. It comprises of 4 properties:
        </p>

        <ol>

          <li>Content: The text/picture being represented.</li>
          <li>Padding: The space around the text/picture.</li>
          <li>Border: The border around the text/picture.</li>
          <li>Margin: The space around the border.</li>
        </ol>
