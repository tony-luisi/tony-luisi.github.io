        <h4>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
        
        <p>
          To use the analogy in <a href="./t2-html-css-dom-p1.html" >my previous blog</a>, if HTML is the cake recipe, and CSS is the cake decoration, then Javscript could be considered lit candles, rotating cake stand, etc. Essentially javascript super charges web pages, adding many extensions not provided by the limitations of CSS or HTML.
        </p> 

        <p>
          Javascript adds to web pages a whole host of additional funcationally, inclduing the ability to add animation and transitions, interactivity, client side processing, etc. While the trademark for javascript was originally owned by Sun Microsystems (which was bought out by Oracle Corporation), the use of it has been licensed to organisations that implement its use (such as the Mozilla Foundation). 
        </p>

        <h4> What are control flow and loops using a process from everyday life</h4>
        
        <p>
          Control flow allow programs to make different choices and therefore take different paths. Loops allow programs to repeat specific actions many times. Rather than explain the different types of control flows and loops, I have decided to write some pseudocode instead. Hopefully this will help to not only demonstrate the different type of flows/loops, but also to show how they work:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
          while (teeth are not brushed){

              if (toothbrush has no toothpaste) {
                apply toothpaste on brush
                add water
              }

              for (ten times) {
                brush tooth with toothbrush
              }

              if (all teeth are not brushed) {
                go to the next tooth
              } else {
                teeth are brushed
              }
              
          }
          </code></pre>

        <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals?</h4>
        
        <p>
          Before explaining the difference, it might be good to quickly define what an array and an object literal is.
        </p>

        <p>
          An array is essentially a container which allows you to store different types of objects (for example, strings, integers, etc). An object literal on the other hand allows you to not only store different types of objects, but also allows you to act on those objects (termed functions). While they are both containers for object, data is accessed from each type differently:
        </p>

        <p>
          Array data is accessed using <em>numbers</em>:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
          var myContainer = new Array();
          myContainer[0] = "Hello";
          myContainer[1] = "World!";
          
          console.log(myContainer[0]); //prints Hello
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          Object data is accessed using <em>names</em>:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
          var myContainer = new Object();
          myContainer.first = "Hello";
          myContainer.second = "World!";

          console.log(myContainer["first"]); //prints Hello
        </code></pre>



        <h4>What are functions and why they are useful?</h4>
        
        <p>
          Functions are a structure in javascript (as well as many other programming languages) and are useful for many important reasons:

        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>They can be used to perform a specific <b>repeatable task</b> over and over again (which helps prevent excessive and redundant code).</li>
            <li>They can be used to <b>split up long pieces of code</b> into smaller manageable tasks (which helps for code reuse).</li>
            <li>When used as part of objects (functions are called methods when they relate to objects), they can be used to <b>validate inputs</b> to enforce the integrity of data (e.g. for a Person object, a function can be used to check the validity of a person's age, and prevent a ridiculous value (such as -5 or 2000!)).</li>
          </ol>
