        <h5>Week 5</h5>
        <h4>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem, and solved it in an elegant way:</h4>
        
        <p>
          I suppose doing the javascript racer project was challenging in a number of ways. One particular example was desgining the number of players. I had designed it to take multiple players from 1 to 9. I didn't realise how challenging this proved to be, especially because I would possibly need to write code to cater for multiple players, including:
        </p> 
        <ol>
          <li>Creating a race track for multiple players. </li>
          <li>Making multiple players move across the race track. </li>
          <li>Programming each key press to make the players move. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Consequently, I may have needed to write a lot of repeating code (i.e. the same code for each player).
        </p>

        <p>
          To solve this, I could have just changed my design (which would have been an easier solution), however, I wanted to see if it was possible to solve. Luckily enough I did come up with an elegant solution, which was to assign each player a number key corresponding to the player number (i.e. Player 1 is assigned the number 1 key, Player 2 the number 2 key, etc).
        </p>

        <p>
          This ultimately allowed me to write a single set of code, and iterate through each of the players using looping code. While at the beginning of the process I felt daunted, solving it game me a great sense of accomplishment, and a great feeling of satisfaction. I also learned a few things in Javascript that I didn't know before (e.g. how to emulate computer key presses).
        </p>

        <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process.</h4>
        
        <p>
          I'm pretty confident when it comes to using most of the problem solving techniques. Ultimately though I use them each at different stages:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pseudocode: Ususally at the beginning when I'm conceptualising a solution. </li>
          <li>Trying something: Usually before I have a concrete solution or method of implementation, i'll use this to test an idea I may have.</li>
          <li>Rubber Ducky method: Maybe if I'm really stuck on a specific task (I don't usually use this method).</li>
          <li>Console logging: Generally only log to the console when I'm debugging a piece of code that isn't quite right.</li>
          <li>Googling: Probably what I use the most, especially because I can't remember all the css attributes, etc.</li>
          <li>Asking your peers for help: Haven't used much yet, probably because we aren't at bootcamp yet.</li>
          <li>Asking coaches for help: Same as above.</li>
          <li>Improving your process with reflection: Not used a lot, generally at the end once I've finished.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</h4>
        
        <p>
          .map(): The .map() function is used when you want to perform a specific task on each element of an array. For example, let's say that I wanted to "cut" every orange, and I had 50 oranges. Instead of writing 50 separate pieces of code to cut each orange, I would use the map function and only write one piece of code, and pass through the 50 oranges.
        </p>

        <p>
          .filter(): The .filter() function allows you to essentially filter an array using specific criteria. For example, if I wanted to return only oranges from an array of fruit, I would use the filter function to very easily and quickly return only an array of oranges.
        </p>

        <p>
          .reduce(): The .reduce() function is able to perform a task on every element of an array, and return the aggregated answer. For example, let's say I had 50 baskets of oranges, with each basket containing a different number of oranges. If I wanted to know how many oranges I had in total, instead of going through and meticulously counting every single orange in each basket, I could use the reduce function to return to me the total number of oranges in a few lines of code.
