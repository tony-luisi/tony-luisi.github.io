        <h5>Week 6</h5>
        <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
        
        <p>
          Using self-awareness to gain mastery over our emotions. Self regulation is about becoming more aware of your emotions, analysing them and becoming constructively responsive to them as a result. Whether or not those emotions are good or bad, it's really about taking control of oneself (hence being self aware).
        </p> 

        <p>
          That is also to say that it's not about becoming one without emotions (unless you're Vulcan of course!), it's about being letting go of the emotions we don't want, while embracing the emotions that we do want. Reducing our suffering by separating the pain, and the emotion(s) that comes with pain, or conversely, separating pleasure, and the emotion(s) that come with pleasure. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I also liked how it talked about dealing with distress and negative emotions, and gave some good hints and tips I definitely see myself using.
        </p>

        <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
        
        <p>
          I suppose I'm not sure exactly how I feel about the two minutes of mindfulness. I suppose as each chapter progresses, I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly anymore (possibly due to the fact that I've either forgotten, or that I am incoporating information from the subsequent chapters). Either way, I suppose I need to do some reading of the mindfulness chapter again!
