        <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
        
        <p>
          In order to become more self aware about oneself, requires one to focus and clear one's mind. Self awareness I think is just the next step in the process of looking within oneself. Without the ability to clear one's mind and focus, you cannot take a step back and critically analyse your own emotions and behaviour.
        </p> 

        <h4> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
        
        <p>
          Body scanning was an interesting experience because I didn't realise that I may keep emotions in parts of my body other than my head. I suppose I was skeptical at first, but once I tried it I realised how enjoyable of experience it was. Ultimately, it has helped me to improve my emotional awareness and self-awareness in general.
        </p>

        <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</h4>
        
        <p>
          As mindfulness becomes stronger, there's a shift that goes from existential ("I am angry") to physiological ("I experience anger in my body"). Once you are out of the frame that "these emotions are who I am", then it becomes something that can be changed (you gain mastery over emotions). If emotions are you, you can't change it, but if emotions are what happen to you, then you can experience them mindfully.
