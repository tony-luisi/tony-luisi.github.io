        <h2>My EDA experience</h2>
        <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
        
        <p>
          I learnt that emotional intelligence, is a skill, and like any skill can be taught. It also reminded me of all the things I need to focus on during my course and life in general (for example, improving my attention and focus, being aware of my emotional states, etc).
        </p> 



        <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
        
        <p>
          It was good to take time out for two minutes just to zone out and contemplate just being. I think it's a helpful reminder that we shouldn't take our own existence for granted, and how little time we have on earth. Therefore, we need to get the most out of life and living.
