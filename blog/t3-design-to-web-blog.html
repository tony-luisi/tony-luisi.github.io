        <h5>Week 3</h5>
        <h4>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</h4>
        
        <p>
          A responsive site is any web page that automatically resizes itself depending on the size of the screen or browser. In this day and age websites are viewed on screens big and small, whether you are looking at it on your biggest desktop monitor, to the smallest phone. Responsiveness websites allow us not only adapt the content to fit each screen perfectly, it allows optimal viewing depending on the screen.
        </p> 

        <p>
          For example, a website that has been designed for a mobile screen may only have one column of text. This is because a mobile phone screen is usually very small and therefore trying to see text distributed into two columns may be very difficult to see. However, one column of text when viewed on a large widescreen monitor might be easy to see, but fails to take advantage of the huge real estate given to you by the bigger monitor. Therefore, there should be a way to view content in multiple columns for a big screen, and then one column for a small screen. This is what a responsive site caters for.
        </p>

        <h4>What is mobile first design, and why is it important?</h4>
        
        <p>
          Mobile first design is where content is formatted according to mobile devices in the first instance. If the content is being viewed on a larger device (for example, a laptop), the website then re-formats for the larger device.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is so important due to the fact that smaller devices usually have little processing power to render web pages, as well as slower internet connections (for example, 3G). Therefore, for web sites to be very responsive on small devices need to load data very quickly. If the mobile data is loaded first, mobile devices will be able to load a correctly formatted mobile page faster than if the mobile data is loaded fast. Bigger devices (such as tablets or laptops) have less limitations and therefore can wait for all the data to load before correctly rendering the page.
        </p>

        <h4>What are frameworks, and their pros and cons?</h4>
        
        <p>
          Frameworks are essentially a foundation (base) on which we can build a website. It establishes some rules / guidelines / tools in which we can use to build our site. You can almost think of it like building a house. A framework to build a house could give you instructions on how to build a kitchen, or dining area, or bathroom etc. You can use it as a foundation for a kitchen (for instance, it could tell you where to put a bench, stove, etc), and then you would tailor it to meet your needs).
        </p>

        <p>
          The advantage of using a framework is that it allows you to hit the ground running once you have your plan (wireframe). You can quickly use it to create the bones of your website as it has many of the foundational components that go into your website (for example, how to add and format a button). On the other hand, some frameworks (for example, the skeleton framework) can be somewhat limited in what is implemented, and therefore, you may need to heavily customise to get the expected look-and-feel of your webiste.
        </p>

        <h4>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h4>
        
        <p>
          A wireframe is essentially a drawing which depicts at a very high level what elements will go into your website, and where they will be placed. For example, where and what size the heading will be, what images you plan to include and where, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          They are used because it is always good to come up with an initial plan for what a website is going to look like, and allows you to structure your webiste (instead of spending hundreds of hours winging it in front of a computer and therefore wasting a lot of time). They can also be used as a collaboration tool (a starting point for a team who are designing a website to discuss what the website is going to look like, without all the effort of building the website).
        </p>

        <h4>What aspects of your wireframes did you find difficult to implement, and why?</h4>
        
        <p>
          The trickiest part of my wireframes was centering the text (by using the CSS sheet, instead of putting the styles directly into the HTML), as well as getting the sections right (i.e. where my header / main / footer started and stopped etc). I found that getting the sections right the first time is extremely key when it comes to formatting using CSS, otherwise you may need to spend a lot of time going back to update and backfill your HTML with classes / sections / ids in order to get your website formatted properly.
