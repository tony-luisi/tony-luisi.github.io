        <h5>Week 9</h5>
        <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>

        <p>
          I have experienced in my career both compassionate and non-compassionate leadership. I don't necessarily think that there is something wrong with non-compassionate leadership, but it is definitely a different style of leadership that does take some getting used to. The reason I say that is because I admire how business saavy and cunning some leaders are, and I think these traits are more amplified / apparent with non-compassionate leaders. I have worked for both compassionate and non-compassionate leaders, and in my humble opinion, there is times when a leader needs to make some really difficult decision and stand their ground. I suppose I admire their tenaciousness because sometimes ruthlessness is necessary (not all the time though).
        </p>

        <p>
          My preferred style though are compassionate leaders. I think I enjoy working for and with them because they tend to be more empathetic, and more weary or sensitive to morale. Leaders who are caring and compassionate make their employees feel happy and want to work for them. That I think brings the whole team forward.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>

        <p>
          Very soothing. It's comforting to know that most people I have met and interacted with I believe are genuinely good people. Including my friends and family. I suppose it's good to think that people are inherenlty good, and it's only pressure, circumstances and rationalisation that turn them into less than good people.
        </p>

        <p>
          It also makes me want to be more good, and put my doubts aside. It gives me more motivation to just say "yes" to things and not saying no to things all the time. Takes a lot of courage I think.
        </p>

        <h4> Do the tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>

        <p>
          I found this quite difficult to master. I think I have trouble experiencing empathy of others, I suppose it's because of my logical brian, and my general unwillingness to be emotional. Even when people are feeling emotionally hurt right in front of me, I sometimes have a hard time empathising with them, which I suppose can come of as being unfeeling (which I suppose could be true). Also, it makes me think back to when I try and crack a joke or be sarcastic in some way, I come off as being serious, which is not what I intended, and is sometimes very frustrating.
        </p>

        <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your phase-0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h4>

        <p>
        <em>Status:</em> I suppose people sometimes have difficulty taking constructive criticism, and therefore sometimes shy away from posting their code, or even asking questions for fear that it might be a stupid one. I suppose to get over this, this is supposed to be a learning environment, and therefore we should feel comfortable to post our questions or code, no matter how stupid it may seem. Also might take a bit of politeness when giving feedback to others (or doing it indiviudally rather than posting it on an open channel - if we don't feel comfortable).
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Certainty:</em> Definitely an important behaviour. Learning new things already means that uncertainty is a given. Making things certain will ultimately need to come with time, routine and hard work.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Autonomy:</em> This is tough considering I am meeting new people, learning new things, as well as moving to a different city. I suppose that I feel the least Autonomous during phase-0, and expecting this to continue during bootcamp.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Relatedness:</em> Haven't really seen too much relevant to phase-0 with this. However, pair programming could be seen to be related to this. I suppose this is because when you first meet someone to pair program with, you're not always sure what your comparative skill levels are, and whether or not they're going to work well with you, or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Fairness:</em> Self sacrificing your time to help out others who may be struggling provides a sense of fairness, whether in person, or on Slack. I suppose there is a benefit though, you confirm your understanding, and can learn something in the process.
        </p>

        <h4>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h4>

        <p>
          I haven't really had an opportunity to have a difficult conversation. I will try and practice it the next time I need to have one.
