        <h2>My EDA experience</h2>
        <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
        
        <p>
        I tried the following techniques: 
        <ul>
          <li>The power of meditation</li>
          <li>How Mindfulness can improve productivity, focus, and work life balance</li>
          <li>Pomodoro technique</li>
          <li>Create a habit</li>
          <li>Tiny habits / Fogg method</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
        
        <p>
        The technique I found the most intersting was the Pomodoro technique. Splitting my time into 25 minute increments seems like an easy way to focus on specific tasks that I want to get completed. Furthermore, the technique is also about estimating how long is takes to perform each task I perform.
        </p>

        <p>
        I also found the material around Tiny Habits and the Fogg method interesting. By doing big tasks incrementally at a time and not focusing on trying to accomplish the big picture all at once is a good way to make sure I can form long last repeatable habits. 
        </p>

        <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
        
        <p>
        The techniques listed above I think are the ones that will work for me the most. The other techniques (e.g. growth mindset, counter-intuitive productivity, flow, etc) don't rreally appeal to me as either I am already aware and have used these techniques, or seem too much of an abstract concept to want to execute (I like practical solutions!).
        </p>
        <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
        
        <p>
        Going forward, I think I will focus on experimenting on meditation, the Pomodoro technique, and tiny habits.
