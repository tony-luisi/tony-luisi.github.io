        <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
        
        <p>
        I suppose taking a leaf from my first technical blog, everything on a web page is essentially a box. An extension of that is a grid (which I suppose if you think about it, is a collection of multiple boxes of the same size, ordered into columns and rows).
        </p> 

        <p>
        Grid based design is a way to structure a web page into logical sections to make it easier to format and create a layout.
        </p>

        <h3>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
        
        <p>
        Due to the sheer number of different web browsers and devices in the aether, responsive web pages are a way to make sure each user gets the best experience regardless of the browser / device they are using.
        </p>
        <p>
        Responsive web pages can be characterised by their ability to be fluid (i.e. automatically resizing to fit the size and shape of the screen), and the use of CSS3 media queries (often denoted as the @media rule).
        </p>
        <h3>Semantic structure</h3>
        
        <p>
        Simply put, semantic structure is representing an html element based on it's meaning, rather than just how it is presented. For example, the tag &lt;nav&gt; generally represents a section of your page that will contain a navigation menu. Semantic elements improve the readability of html code, as well as improving the ability of search engines to work out what each section of your web page is (for example, where your footer is).
        </p>

        <p>
        HTML5 introduced a number of new semantic tags including mark, time, section and footer.
        </p>
