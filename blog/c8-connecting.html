        <h5>Week 8</h5>
        <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>

        <p>
          I really connected with this idea and helped me to reflect on why I am here, and have decided to go on this particular journey. While I really did enjoy what I was doing in my previous job (which was IT Auditing), I suppose to reach a better sense of passion and fulfil a higher purpose, I'm doing something different.
        </p>

        <p>
          I suppose we all like to spend out time in the pleasure part of life, but given it doesn't last for long, and we have a tendency to habituate to it, can seem empty in the long run without passion or higher purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          Incentives don't just come in the form of monetary reimbursement. I suppose what higher purpose tells us is that if we try and aim for things that are ultruistic, while doing something that we enjoy doing, then the outcome is its own reward.          
        </p>
        
        <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, What are your core values? What do you stand for?</h4>

        <p>
          I suppose my core values are rooted in happiness, integrity, knowledge and truth. Happiness because I believe that people should instrinsicly seek happiness and get happiness within their lives. Integrity, because I believe that people should act with integrity and should expect integrity from others. Truth and knowledge because I believe that people should be open-minded about what they believe in (and should be willing to change their opinions from time to time).
        </p>

        <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>

        <p>
          I found it really enlightening, because it helped me to separate emotional expression (how I was feeling) fro the experience itself. It allowed me to calmly and objectively take a step back at an experience (especially one where I failed), and deconstruct it and almost overcome it.
        </p>

        <h4>Any other musings?</h4>

        <p>
          Not much, except that I really enjoyed this chapter more than the others I have read so far. I suppose that's because I have found this chapter the most useful. It's something I can use to reflect on the journey I have been, and well as arm me with the right tools on the journey that I'm about to take!
