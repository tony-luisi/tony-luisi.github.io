        <h5>Week 8</h5>
        <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h4>

        <p>
          I was really surprised at how much we can have unconscious bias tendencies, and therefore, empathy (or lack thereof) can affect our ability to trust others, or be sincere. I tried the 'Just like me and loving kindness meditation', it was an interesting experience. I suppose it made my unconscious bias more conscious, which is all part of being self-aware. It made me feel like I could be a bit more objective and put any bias I have aside.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>

        <p>
          This is something that I have had a lot of experience with, especially in my previous job. Working at my job, there was a great coaching culture. It came in all forms, whether it was on the job coaching, training or career / mentor coaching. Empathetic listening is a great way to understand and connect with the person who is speaking, but it's also a way get the person who has the problem or conflict to come to their own conclusion and solution.
        </p>

        <h4> How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>

        <p>
          Suppose I've already answered the question, but, I really think that while it is good to practice on your own, I'm also willing to try it in my future interactions, especially with new people that I have just met.
        </p>

        <h4>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h4>

        <p>
          A difficult situation I had to deal with on a regular basis in my previous job was resourcing of staff. Consistenly at work there was always a lot of work for clients to be delievered, and not enough staff to do it in the time that it needed to be done. On top of this, there were always budget constraints where it was generally financially better to book more junior staff, although sometimes more senior staff were more efficient.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes people would be booked on the same jobs at the same time (resourcing conflict). In order to resolve this, it meant that someone would have to release them from their job. This could go either way depending on the person who was managing the other booking. If the other person was easy to negotiate with, then generally a positive outcome for both would more than likely. Otherwise, sometimes the other person would be difficult, or perhaps, understandably, they had their own point of view.
        </p>

        <p>
          I suppose in that situation, it always made sense to be politically aware and empathetic about the situation. Understanding how that other person felt and coming up with a comprimising solution always went better when you understood the pressure that the other person was under, or how other people might be influencing their decision. Ultimately, it was always better to resolve conflict by presenting an actual solution, rather than just saying that you had a problem you needed to resolve.
