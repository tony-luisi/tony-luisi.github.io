        <h4>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h4>
        
        <p>
          The EDA experience I think is focused on a group of people getting together who are enthuastic, committed and hungry to learn about software development and coding. 
        </p>

        <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
        
        <p>
          I think that the EDA culture is really attuned to people who really want to be there (in the words of Shereef - a creator mindset), and don't want to take the conventional path to programming (i.e. spending three years at a University). So far, I am really impressed and can't wait to get to the bootcamp.
        </p>

        <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
        
        <p>
          Because of where I am in my life (i.e. I have spent 8 years since graduating University involved in performing IT and System Audits for some of the biggest businesses in NZ), I am not keen on wasting my time. From what I know of the culture so far, I will be surrounded by people from all walks of life, who are hungry and eager to learn. I think being in this kind of environment will magnify my ability to learn and grow, and is something I have been looking for.
        </p>
        <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
        
        <p>
          Not really, however, I didn't expect so many people to actually be from overseas.
        </p>

        <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
        
        <p>
          I am super excited and enthusiastic to be given this opportunity, however, yes it makes me very nervous!
